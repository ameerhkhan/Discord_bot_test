This should server as a guide to the bot created and the functions it can perform.

The Following python packages are to be installed (via pip or some other way)
- Discord.py
- loadenv

Things you can change,
- Two files are being given to you,
    1. bot_dm.py
    2. .env

The bot_dm.py is the python file for the bot in which Following parameters can be changed as per
preferences,
1 - MESSAGE -> This is the message that will be dm'ed to all members of the server the bot is part of.
    FORMAT: (str), Just write the message within the inverted commas.
2 - time_to_kick -> This is the number of days after which 
    FORMAT: (int), A number is to be input over here.

The .env file contains important information regarding server and tokens which should not be shared
with unknown people. This ofcourse can also be edited to meet preferences.
1 - DISCORD_TOKEN -> This is the token provided by Discord so we can connect our bot to Discord's API
                    and shouldn't be changed unless absolutely necessary.
2 - DISCORD_GUILD -> This the name of Server whose member you would like to send your messages to. Keep in
                    mind that your bot needs to be a member of the server itself.
                    Change to match the exact name of the server (CASE SENSITIVE)

Following is a list of functions that the bot can do along with instructions on how to
invoke them or if they are automatically invoked.

1 - Send message to new member when he joins
Invocation Method: Automatically invoked
This command automatically sends message to any member who joins.
The message can obviously be tailored to meet requirements.
Just put the new message between the inverted commas and you are good to go.

2 - Test Command
Invocation Method: Write "!test" on a channel in a server (without the inverted commas)
Invocation Restrictions: None
Use this command to test out your bot. When invoked, it will reply to you with a message 'Bot Testing 1'.
This message can also be changed and further messages can be added as well which will then be chosen randomly.
For example, funny quotes or facts can be added to messages list separated by a ',' and the bot
will randomly choose a message and display it.

3 - Mass Messaging command
Invocation Method: Wrtie "!dmm" on a channel in a server (without the inverted commas)
Invocation Restrictions: Will only be invoked if the Admin of the channel writes the command.
Use this command for mass messaging/dm'ing all of the members in your server with a custom message.
The custom message can be set according to needs in the VARIABLE named 'MESSAGE' as discussed above.

4 - Link Removal Command
Invocation Method: Automatically invoked
Invocation Restrictions: Will only remove links that have not been posted by 'ogminter'
This command is automatically invoked whenever a member that is not an admin tries to post a link
to a channel. This is a bonus command that will add good moderation to any server.

5 - Kick Command
Invocation Method: Wrtie "!status" on a channel in a server (without the inverted commas)
Invocation Restrictions: Can only be invoked by an Admin.
Update -- Version 2:
Invocation has been programmed to be automated and the script now checks the status of members every 12 hours.

Use this command to kick out members that have been inactive for an amount of days that has been set.
The days can be set in the VARIABLE named, time_to_kick (currently at 60 days)

Creates two new CSV files which contain information regarding offline and online statuses of every member.
last_online.csv
latest_online.csv

Running the BOT:
################
The bot can be run on any computer having a valid installation of Python (version >= 3.7.7)
Just save the file in a folder and go into that folder using a command prompt and type,
    > python bot_final.py
Keep in mind that ".env" file should reside in the same folder as the Python Script.
Also to keep the bot online you will have to keep the computer turned on all the time as well.

The bot can also be hosted online which will keep the bot running indefinitely.
There are various services that provide Free and Paid options to host the bot.
Please choose accordingly.

Points to Remember:
###################
- To send messages to members of a GUILD/SERVER, the bot needs to be added to the server by an Admin or
a moderator of said server.
- Best way to get members onto a server is via good marketing practices usually involving an influencer.
- Test out the kick command when the you have more than enough members as has been seen a lot of the
members stay offliine for longer periods of time but jump right back in when important dates arrive.
In such a case, you wouldn't want to loose valuable clients just because they were a bit lazy.
